                I love music! I could talk about music all day. Let's be honest, sometimes the personal lives of the artists can make their music sound like it hit a sour note!
                    The idea of All Music Chatter came about while I was talking to my sister about music. We would discuss an artist, and then some of their personal life would eek into the conversation.
                    I was more interested in talking about the music than I was the drama. So at All Music Chatter, the talk is about the MUSIC not the DRAMA! We've all got our own issues and we often turn
                    to music to soothe us. There are so many juicy details and interesting tidbits in the music alone, that we don't even have time to get into the proclivities or latest gossip headlines of 
                    the personal lives of the artists. So here it's ALL MUSIC ALL THE TIME! I hope you enjoy!
