                <h1>90s RnB is the Best RnB</h1>
                <p>There is no era of Rythm and Blues music that compares to the 1990s. Granted, I am most likely biased having grown up in the 1990s. However, I have love for so many different eras and genres of music
                    that it can't possibly be just because I came into my adolecense in the 1990s. Every decade had their own sound; in the 1960s, disco was booming, in the late 60s thru the 1970s the funk ruled the
                    airwaves, the 1980s were...well, that's a different blog post in itself (punk, glam, and grunge rock were big but the 80s seemed highly experimental). There was something about the rythms, 
                    the harmonies, and the melodies of the 1990s.
