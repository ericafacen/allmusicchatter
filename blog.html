                <p>RnB was not created in the 1990s, but it was perfected in the 1990s.</p>

                <h2>The Gospel Influence</h2>
                <p>Just about any RnB group you talk to that was making music in the 1990s will tell you when you ask, exactly where their inspiration came from.
                    Much like their forebearers from the 1980s and 1970s, singers were influenced by the Gospel music they heard growing up in church.

                <h2>The Sweet Spot of 1996</h2>
                <p>When it comes to RnB music, there is just something about 1996. In truth, when it comes to music in general 1996 was a banner year.
                    There was so much great music playing that it's kind of hard to keep up with it all.

                <h2>The Hip Hop of the 1990s</h2>
                <p>If you thought the RnB of the 90s was fire, you have to know the Hip Hop was too. Was there something in the water?! Some of the greatest Hip Hip
                    albums of all time were released in the 1990s. The Hip Hop that later generations would be birthed from.
